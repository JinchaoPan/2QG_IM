## Project Overview üîç
The time evolution system governing  the fields involved in this equilibrium state constitutes the subject of quasi-geographic (QG) theory, yielding the so-called QG models which  describe  the essential characteristics of the geophysical fluid flows.

In practice, the Rossby number $Ro$ is small $(O(10^{-3}))$, so a highly refined mesh is required to direct numerical simulation of model, which leads to a time-consuming calculation scheme and requires a significant amount of computational memory. To overcome this difficulty, many researchers have introduced the large eddy simulation (LES) technique.
