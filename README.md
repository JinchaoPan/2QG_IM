## Project Overview üîç
The time evolution system governing  the fields involved in this equilibrium state constitutes the subject of quasi-geographic (QG) theory, yielding the so-called QG models which  describe  the essential characteristics of the geophysical fluid flows.  

we proposed a linearized iterative scheme(IM) to compute the  non-dimensional potential vorticity  and stream function in 2-dimensional space successively.

In practice, the Rossby number $Ro$ is small $(O(10^{-3}))$ in QG model, so a highly refined mesh is required to direct numerical simulation of model, which leads to a time-consuming calculation scheme and requires a significant amount of computational memory. To overcome this difficulty, many researchers have introduced the large eddy simulation (LES) technique.

In our work, we set the Rossby number $Ro$ not too small($Ro$ =1.5,0.088) to avoid the requirement of highly refined mesh or LES technology. Our objective is to develop an efficient algorithm that is different from traditional direct numerical simulation(DNS).


## Quick Start üöÄ
